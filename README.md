# BotBrains Battle Round-2  
This repository contains the software and documentation for developing an autonomous parcel delivery robot using a Two Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot (TWSBR). The robot is designed to navigate urban environments, handle traffic, turns, and obstacles to deliver parcels autonomously to consumer doorsteps.  

## Documentation 

Path Planning Strategies: Detailed explanation of global and local path planning strategies integrated into the robot's navigation system.  
Implementation Plan: Overview of software architecture, control algorithms, and sensor integration strategies.  
  
## Code  
Control Algorithms: Implementations of PID control for balance, obstacle avoidance algorithms using LIDAR data, and trajectory planning for smooth navigation.  
Speech Recognition and Synthesis: Scripts for implementing human-robot interaction using speech recognition and synthesis libraries.
